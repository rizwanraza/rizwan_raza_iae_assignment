# Simple Multi-Agent Chat System (Prototype)

## Overview
This repository contains a minimal multi-agent system prototype implemented in Python that demonstrates:
- Coordinator agent orchestrating worker agents
- ResearchAgent (mock web search), AnalysisAgent (reasoning & comparisons), MemoryAgent (structured memory + vector search)
- Task decomposition, inter-agent message passing (via method calls), traceable logs, and simple adaptive decision making.

This implementation is intentionally lightweight and self-contained (no external LLMs required). The MemoryAgent uses a simple in-memory vector store (bag-of-words / sparse counters) + keyword search.

## Files
- `main.py` : Primary Python script implementing the Coordinator and agents and sample tests.
- `Dockerfile` : Build a container for the system.
- `docker-compose.yml` : Run the service container (runs `main.py` on start).
- `outputs/` : Contains sample outputs for the 5 required scenarios (generated by `main.py`).
- `README.md` : This README.

## Architecture & Sequence Flow
1. **User** sends a natural-language query to the `Coordinator`.
2. **Coordinator** performs a simple complexity analysis:
   - may consult memory via vector similarity search
   - plans whether to call ResearchAgent and/or AnalysisAgent
3. **ResearchAgent** retrieves simulated documents from a preloaded mock KB (plus consults MemoryAgent's KB).
4. **AnalysisAgent** runs rule-based comparisons/analysis over research results.
5. **Coordinator** synthesizes the answer, logs the trace, and persists a synthesized finding into MemoryAgent's KB for future reuse.

The coordinator logs each step and the payloads, enabling traceability.

## Memory Design
- **Conversation Memory**: list of conversation records with timestamps and metadata.
- **Knowledge Base**: each KB record stores title, content, source, agent, topics, confidence, timestamp. Embeddings are computed as simple bag-of-words counters and stored with each record. Vector similarity is cosine over token counts.
- **Agent State Memory**: per-agent task records describing what was done.

Search:
- `kb_search_keyword(keyword)` for substring/keyword matches.
- `kb_similarity(text)` for vector similarity matches.

## How to run (locally)
Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- No external packages required.

1. Clone or copy files into a directory.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
